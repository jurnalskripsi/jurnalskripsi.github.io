                                            I Wandered Lonely as a Cloudby William Wordsworth (1770-1850)I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o'er vales and hills,When all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils,Beside the lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.Continuous as the stars that shine And twinkle on the milk way,They stretched in never-ending lineAlong the margin of a bay:Ten thousand saw I at a glance, Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.The waves beside them danced; but theyOut-did the sparkling waves in glee; A poet could not but be gay, In such a jocund company; I gazed and gazed but little thoughtWhat wealth the show to me had brought:For oft, when on my couch I lieIn vacant or in pensive mood, They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils.Answer the questions based on the poem above: 1. Excerpt two lines that contain simile! What comparisons does the poet make?2. Excerpt two lines that contain personification and describe what things are made human?3. Excerpt two lines from the poem that contain hyperbole? Which words that show overstatement?4. How does the use of these figures of speech affect to the things described in the poem?5. What's the tone of the speaker in this poem? Which words or phrases represent the tone of the speaker?​</a>

Bayu : Definitely! My dad and I are going to go fishing. We plan
 to go fishing in a lake near my uncle’s house. Would you
 like to come with us?
Santi : I don’t really like fishing. I would rather stay at home
 than go fishing. What about you, Riri? What would you
 like to do on the long weekend?
Riri : I have made a plan with my mother about what to do
 on this long weekend. We are going to practice baking
 cookies.
Bayu : Are you going to bake choco chips cookies like the last
 time?
Riri : Well, yes. That is my favourite. But we will also try to
 make ginger cookies.
Riri : Oh, would you like to join me to learn baking cookies?
 You can come to my house.
Bayu : It’s a good idea! Or will you go fishing with me and my
 dad?
Santi : Uhm, not fishing I guess. But I think I would like to
 bake cookies with Riri. Thanks for asking me to join you
 Riri.

                                            An excerpt from Barbara Willard's The Sprig of Broom: "It was mid-October, the harvest (1) well stored. The sun was as hot as if it shone (2) in the first week of September, but (3) a tumbling sky threw great clouds before the wind, and when the sun was obscured then all the promise of winter was in the air. But it was magic weather, a gift to sweeten the sadness of (4) the ending year. There were still blackberries, thick and dripping with juice, but these would remain (5) on the bushes, for by now, as it was said, the Devil had spat on them and they should not be eaten. So birds gorged themselves, and the ground and the leaves of the brambles were strewn with purple droppings. The water, half shadow and half glitter, threw back the colours of beech and bracken tossing them over the boulders like gold and copper coins."

But the knight was not in the least ruffled. He said he might be a little in advance of his age, but no matter—science would come to be honored, some time or other. He said he would march against the dragon in the morning. Out of compassion, then, a decent spear was offered him, but he declined, and said, "spears were useless to men of science." They allowed him to sup in the servants' hall, and gave him a bed in the stables.
How was this knight different from the others?

b. his ideas were more progressive than others
c.he woke up earlier than the others

On that bright and sunny Saturday morning, the radio station was full of fans. They were exited to wait for Afgan. They were ready to see his performance on the meet-and-greet. When he was finished with the song, the host announced that it was time for autographing the memorabilia. I prepared my CDs and began to stand in the line. When I arrived at the table, I was speechless. It was unreal just seeing him that close. I thought it was really cool seeing him like that because he really just felt like a normal person, which was awesome. He was also very friendly, so I didn’t feel too nervous when I had a chance to take pictures with him. He was just an amazing person.

In some ways, he had a fantastic job: he had been promoted many times and felt that his boss was very fair.

He had studied to be a graphic designer at university, but in his Marketing job, he rarely had the opportunity to be creative and design pieces. Instead, he wrote slogans designed to sell products that he would never buy himself. Why didn't Mr. Peterson like his job?

c He felt that his boss was unfair.

and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again;
compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent
of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged.Why does life seem “hollow, and existence but a burden” to Tom?a. It is a hot day.b. It will take him a long time to whitewash all of the fence.c. He would rather sit down all day. d.The whitewash smells bad.e.he top of the fence is too high for him to reach.</a>

                            9. I Wandered Lonely as a Cloudby William Wordsworth (1770-1850)I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o'er vales and hills,When all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils,Beside the lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.Continuous as the stars that shine And twinkle on the milk way,They stretched in never-ending lineAlong the margin of a bay:Ten thousand saw I at a glance, Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.The waves beside them danced; but theyOut-did the sparkling waves in glee; A poet could not but be gay, In such a jocund company; I gazed and gazed but little thoughtWhat wealth the show to me had brought:For oft, when on my couch I lieIn vacant or in pensive mood, They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils.Answer the questions based on the poem above: 1. Excerpt two lines that contain simile! What comparisons does the poet make?2. Excerpt two lines that contain personification and describe what things are made human?3. Excerpt two lines from the poem that contain hyperbole? Which words that show overstatement?4. How does the use of these figures of speech affect to the things described in the poem?5.

                        Perjalanan Jepang dalam keikutsertaannya dalam konflik terbesar sepanjang sejarah perang tidak luput dari hal-hal yang terjadi dalam tubuh internal Jepang sendiri. Hal-hal tersebut menjadi pro dan kontra bagi pihak Jepang sendiri sehingga menimbulkan konflik di dalam tubuh Jepang sendiri. Kita akui kemajuan pesat yang dialami oleh Jepang setelah era kekaisaran Tokugawa yang ditandai dengan adanya ide restorasi meiji ini begitu hebat, baik dari segi pendidikan, ekonomi, sampai dengan tekhnologi semua mengalami westernisasi. Karena seperti diketahui, selama berpuluh-puluh abad sebelumnya Jepang mengalami politik isolasi yang berarti tidak mau mencampuri urusan negara-negara lain, juga tidak menerima pengaruh dari negara-negara lain.<br />

When he was finished with the song, the host announced that it was time for autographing the memorabilia. I prepared my CDs and began to stand in the line. When I arrived at the table, I was speechless. It was unreal just seeing him that close. I thought it was really cool seeing him like that because he really just felt like a normal person, which was awesome. He was also very friendly, so I didn’t feel too nervous when I had a chance to take pictures with him. He was just an amazing person.

                            40. Read the text excerpt and answer the question.Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled
brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy
settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life
to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush
and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again;
compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent
of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged.Why does life seem “hollow, and existence but a burden” to Tom?a. It is a hot day.b. It will take him a long time to whitewash all of the fence.c. He would rather sit down all day. d.The whitewash smells bad.e.he top of the fence is too high for him to reach.</h2><br />
