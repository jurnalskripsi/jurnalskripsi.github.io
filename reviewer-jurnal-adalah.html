                                            Please. This is the sequel to fun in the city, which is a film. I didn't lie. Why my expectations were low. So you could say I wasn't disappointed as it met my expectations. It was awful. It was so awful. I'd rather not spend any more time on it by talking about it, but that wouldn't be a film review and I think I owe you all a review to save you. Wasting your money going to see it. So, it starts off with this big wedding scene and I won't go into why. The whole scene is just there, so they can make this one joke. It's not even a funny joke. It's just, it's just terrible. It's got nothing to do with the rest of the film. Anyway, it starts there. Then instead of the characters and the plot staying in New York, where the original film was set, one of them wins a ticket to India and decides to take all our friends. And it's what directors do when they've run out of ideas? Let's take our characters onto Anyway hey go sit cry and shop and they repeat this until the end. No real people would ever act like this. I didn't have any sympathy for their problems or even care what happened to them. Let's go and see it. You'll only encourage them to make another sequel. World doesn't need three of these films. Please, save you money, and go and see the other big film this week. Twilight mirror. So if you were a fan of the book, it's based on your probably as excited as I was about this for everyone else. This is a film fans have been waiting ten years to see. 
I have to confess. I was a bit nervous. I'd seen the posters and they didn't look right. I didn't love them. At all. And I wasn't sure about the actors they cost either. So I went in not sure what to expect. Act. I loved it. One thing I really liked about it. They went backwards and forwards between the real world and the computer world and it worked really Did the special effects, brought the computer world to life and I totally believed in it. But more than that, I felt emotionally connected to the story and the characters, the whole film worked on. So many levels, it reminded me of going to the cinema as a child. How much fun that was? I can't recommend it enough.

                                            Harry Potter and Philosopher’s Stones
J.K Rowling
Bloomsburry 1997
Paperback
ISBN 0747532745
223pp
Judged by this first volume, the Harry Potter books are a fine addition to English children’s fantasy literature. Harry Potter, orphaned when his parents are killed by the evil wizard Voldemort, is taken in by his aunt and uncle, who are Muggles – ordinary, non-magical people. Harry is rather out of place there, but things improve greatly for him when goes to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry – except that one of the staff is in league with Voldemort. Part of the attention of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone comes from the familiar but at the same time exotic setting of an English public school, complete with houses and schoolboy adventures, in which Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione struggle to save the world and win the house cup. So Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone will be a great Christmas present for kids who haven’t read it yet – and it is a book that adults (at least those without stunted imaginations) can read as well.

                                            Hi, today I'm going to review a book entitled 'The Last Olympian written by Rick Riordan This book is about the final battle against Kronos. Well, Kronos is going to take over Mount Olympus, in New York. Guess who's going to stop him. \Percy and his gang! It's up to him and the rest of his friends to stop Kronos from taking over New York and let me tell you it's one epic battle against him The author pushes his ability to the limit as he explains the battle scenes in so much detail, However, the part that really shines, is the part with Luke and Percy, that was so emotional and entertaining, that it was so good. Also, I like how the author Introduces the mix of Greek Mythology with something modern, he does this so well too So my final response is that it is good and definitely worth to wait, so read it and good luck on your quest! 1. What is the title of the book? 2. What is Kronos going to do? 3. How does the author explain the battle scenes ? 4. What part really shines according to the author? 5. What does the reviewer like from the book?​</a>

                            16. Please. This is the sequel to fun in the city, which is a film. I didn't lie. Why my expectations were low. So you could say I wasn't disappointed as it met my expectations. It was awful. It was so awful. I'd rather not spend any more time on it by talking about it, but that wouldn't be a film review and I think I owe you all a review to save you. Wasting your money going to see it. So, it starts off with this big wedding scene and I won't go into why. The whole scene is just there, so they can make this one joke. It's not even a funny joke. It's just, it's just terrible. It's got nothing to do with the rest of the film. Anyway, it starts there. Then instead of the characters and the plot staying in New York, where the original film was set, one of them wins a ticket to India and decides to take all our friends. And it's what directors do when they've run out of ideas? Let's take our characters onto Anyway hey go sit cry and shop and they repeat this until the end. No real people would ever act like this. I didn't have any sympathy for their problems or even care what happened to them. Let's go and see it. You'll only encourage them to make another sequel. World doesn't need three of these films. Please, save you money, and go and see the other big film this week. Twilight mirror. So if you were a fan of the book, it's based on your probably as excited as I was about this for everyone else. This is a film fans have been waiting ten years to see. 
I have to confess. I was a bit nervous. I'd seen the posters and they didn't look right. I didn't love them. At all. And I wasn't sure about the actors they cost either. So I went in not sure what to expect. Act. I loved it. One thing I really liked about it. They went backwards and forwards between the real world and the computer world and it worked really Did the special effects, brought the computer world to life and I totally believed in it. But more than that, I felt emotionally connected to the story and the characters, the whole film worked on. So many levels, it reminded me of going to the cinema as a child. How much fun that was? I can't recommend it enough.

Judged by this first volume, the Harry Potter books are a fine addition to English children’s fantasy literature. Harry Potter, orphaned when his parents are killed by the evil wizard Voldemort, is taken in by his aunt and uncle, who are Muggles – ordinary, non-magical people. Harry is rather out of place there, but things improve greatly for him when goes to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry – except that one of the staff is in league with Voldemort. Part of the attention of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone comes from the familiar but at the same time exotic setting of an English public school, complete with houses and schoolboy adventures, in which Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione struggle to save the world and win the house cup. So Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone will be a great Christmas present for kids who haven’t read it yet – and it is a book that adults (at least those without stunted imaginations) can read as well.

                            33. Hi, today I'm going to review a book entitled 'The Last Olympian written by Rick Riordan This book is about the final battle against Kronos. Well, Kronos is going to take over Mount Olympus, in New York. Guess who's going to stop him. \Percy and his gang! It's up to him and the rest of his friends to stop Kronos from taking over New York and let me tell you it's one epic battle against him The author pushes his ability to the limit as he explains the battle scenes in so much detail, However, the part that really shines, is the part with Luke and Percy, that was so emotional and entertaining, that it was so good. Also, I like how the author Introduces the mix of Greek Mythology with something modern, he does this so well too So my final response is that it is good and definitely worth to wait, so read it and good luck on your quest! 1. What is the title of the book? 2. What is Kronos going to do? 3. How does the author explain the battle scenes ? 4. What part really shines according to the author? 5. What does the reviewer like from the book?​</h2><br />
                        1. The title of the book is "The Last Olympian."<br />2. Kronos is going to take over Mount Olympus, specifically in New York.<br />3. The author explains the battle scenes in great detail, pushing his ability to the limit.<br />4. According to the reviewer, the part that really shines is the emotional and entertaining interaction between Luke and Percy.<br />5. The reviewer likes how the author blends Greek Mythology with a modern setting, and praises the author's ability to do this effectively. The reviewer also states that the book is worth the wait and encourages others to read it.<br />

Skim the review of typical american , a novel by gish jen. Read the question and then skim the review for the answers. Work as quickly as you can. 
1. Is this a good book for an 11 year old girl? Why or why not
2. Does this seem like a good for vacation reading? Why or why not
3. Is this a good book to read if you are interested in romance? Why or why not
4. Did the reviewer think this was a good book ? How can you tell</h2><br />
                        1. If the girls doesn't really understand english, then I didn't recommend this book. Becuase the words are heavy and pretty much not instersting in my opinion.<br />2. It depends. For people who prefer fiction novel, this isn't really fpr them. This book is most likely for people who love history of people, Iguess.<br />3. For me, I don't think this is good. Because this is pretty much boring and the romance didn't really shown.<br />4. Again, I think this is a good book for people who likes history about person.<br />
